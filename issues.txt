o Age group boundary e.g. Adelaide TJ
 - TJ W U15 Po10 has 10.91m for AO, not in club records
 - TJ W U17 CnC has 12.30m for AO from 2017, but Po10 has this as U20: https://thepowerof10.info/results/results.aspx?meetingid=189039&event=TJ&venue=Birmingham&date=7-Jul-17

Now using runbritain age groups for youth records but still have that anomaly at least

o Wind-assisted example?
- Sophie Detienne 100m V40 record 13.8s in club records but flagged 'w' in Po10

What does 'i' flag mean on Peter Howard's 3000W from 2009 sheet, MV65?

I wish I was still a member of C&C but I think that expired in 2020 - either my spot on the
road 10k should be erased or I've got some other times to give you from the US!
-- need some way to add a manual record to 'annihilate' an automatic find?
